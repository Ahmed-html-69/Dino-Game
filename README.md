## Code Structure
The code is organized using a class-based approach. Here are some key components:
- **DinoGame Class**: Manages game-related functions such as initializing the game, moving the dinosaur, drawing hurdles, and handling gameplay logic.
- **Main Function**: Serves as the entry point for the program. It displays a menu, processes user input, and starts the game or shows instructions.
